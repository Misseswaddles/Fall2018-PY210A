Created by: Carol Farris
Purpose: Mailroom 2
Goal: Use Anaconda linter to write PEP8 Python code
    Comment functions correctly
    Use dict to switch between users selections (completed),
    write thank you letter to the file,
    try to use the dict and .format() to produce the template
    rather than using one big string.

update: need to work on all donors...first show you can print to all donors
         next, you need to print to disk

         then, try to just print to disk from a single thank you. 
         ...so no longer just printing to the command line.
